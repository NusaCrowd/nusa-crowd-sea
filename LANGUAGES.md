# FAQ

### Are non-indigenous but major languages in SEA also accepted?

Yes! We accept non-indigenous languages spoken in SEA regions, e.g., English, Portuguese, Mandarin Chinese, Tamil, Cantonese, etc.
Since this initiative is mainly to represent SEA, please make sure that those datasets are either collected: 1) from speakers in SEA or 2) in SEA regions.

## What about creoles?

A creole is a language that comes from a simplified version of another language, or the mix of two or more languages. In Singapore, people speak a creole that's mostly based on English.
Any creoles that are based on SEA official and/or indigenous languages (e.g., Singlish is based on English) are welcome!

## I want to submit a SEA language/dialect/creole that doesn't exist in the existing options.

Please contact the `moderators` on Discord so we can help to add it.
